                    When we talk about motivating others, the justification is the end result (either we want to avoid the pain or go towards pleasure) or what we want to get the person to do. How we achieve the end result, are our alternatives. As a manager, we need to understand the other person's justification and then come up with alternatives.<br>
                    We may then choose the right alternative. However, in general, we choose the first or the emotionally satisfying one.<br>
                    Typically people stop at this level of analysis and start to act. But a good manager would think of the following also: Will the action guarantee the consequence? What about other unintended consequences? This requires a certain experience. Are we capable of doing this action? Intention and the selection of the most ideal alternative do not guarantee execution, if we do not have the skills and the experience. Most motivational tactics fail, because without execution capability, they is only wishful thinking.
