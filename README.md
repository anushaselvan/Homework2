 Portfolio

 The intent of this web application is to display the skills, work experiences and contact information to the potential employer. This application is built with basic HTML code and CSS styling to elevate the user experience. The navigation link should take the user to the desired section and the responsive layout should make it easier to view the application on different viewports. 

 Here is the overview of the application:
